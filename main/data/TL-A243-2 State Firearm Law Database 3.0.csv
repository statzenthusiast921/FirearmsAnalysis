In evaluating whether such recent threats or acts of violence constitute probable cause to believe that such person poses a risk of imminent personal injury to himself or herself or to others, the judge may consider other factors including, but not limited to (A) the reckless use, display or brandishing of a firearm by such person, (B) a history of the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force by such person against other persons, (C) prior involuntary confinement of such person in a hospital for persons with psychiatric disabilities, and (D) the illegal use of controlled substances or abuse of alcohol by such person. If the judge is satisfied that the grounds for the application exist or that there is probable cause to believe that they exist, such judge shall issue a warrant naming or describing the person, place or thing to be searched. The warrant shall be directed to any police officer of a regularly organized police department or any state police officer.

This clause shall not apply to any make and model of firearm for which a sample of three firearms in new condition all pass the following test: Each of the three samples shall fire 600 rounds, stopping every 100 rounds to tighten any loose screws and to clean the gun if required by the cleaning schedule in the user manual, and as needed to refill the empty magazine or cylinder to capacity before continuing. For any firearm that is loaded in a manner other than via a detachable magazine, the tester shall also pause every 50 rounds for ten minutes. The ammunition used shall be the type recommended by the firearm manufacturer in its user manual or, if none is recommended, any standard ammunition of the correct caliber in new condition. A firearm shall pass this test if it fires the first 20 rounds without a malfunction, fires the full 600 rounds with not more than six malfunctions and completes the test without any crack or breakage of an operating part of the firearm. The term “crack” or “breakage” shall not include a crack or breakage that does not increase the danger of injury to the user. For purposes of evaluating the results of this test, malfunction shall mean any failure to feed, chamber, fire, extract or eject a round or any failure to accept or eject a magazine or any other failure which prevents the firearm, without manual intervention beyond that needed for routine firing and periodic reloading, from firing the chambered round or moving a new round into position so that the firearm is capable of firing the new round properly. “Malfunction” shall not include a misfire caused by a faulty cartridge the primer of which fails to detonate when properly struck by the firearm's firing mechanism. Nineteenth, That no licensee shall sell, rent, lease, transfer or deliver or offer for sale, lease, transfer or delivery any firearm to any purchaser in the commonwealth unless such sale is to a business entity that is primarily a firearms wholesaler, and the sale, by its terms, prohibits such purchaser from reselling such firearm to a firearm retailer or consumer in the commonwealth if such firearm is prone to accidental discharge which, for purposes of this clause, shall mean any make and model of firearm for which a sample of five firearms in new condition all undergo, and none discharge during, the following test: Each of the five sample firearms shall be: (a) test loaded; (b) set so that the firearm is in a condition such that pulling the trigger and taking any action that must simultaneously accompany the pulling of the trigger as part of the firing procedure would fire the handgun; and (c) dropped onto a solid slab of concrete from a height of one meter from each of the following positions: (i) normal firing position; (ii) upside down; (iii) on grip; (iv) on the muzzle; (v) on either side; and (vi) on the exposed hammer or striker or, if there is no exposed hammer or striker, the rearmost part of the firearm. If the firearm is designed so that its hammer or striker may be set in other positions, each sample firearm shall be tested as above with the hammer or striker in each such position but otherwise in such condition that pulling the trigger, and taking any action that must simultaneously accompany the pulling of the trigger as part of the firing procedure, would fire the firearm. Alternatively, the tester may use additional sample firearms of the same make and model, in a similar condition, for the test of each of these hammer striker settings. Twentieth, That no licensee shall sell, rent, lease, transfer or deliver or offer for sale, lease, transfer or delivery, any firearm to any purchaser in the commonwealth unless such sale is to a business entity that is primarily a firearm wholesaler, and the sale, by its terms, prohibits the purchaser from reselling such firearm to a firearm retailer or consumer in the commonwealth if such firearm is prone to: (i) firing more than once per pull of the trigger; or (ii) explosion during firing.",,,,,,,,,,

In the discretion of the justice, such relief may be granted and communicated by telephone to the licensing authority of the municipality where the respondent resides, which shall record such order on a form of order promulgated for such use by the chief justice of the trial court and shall deliver a copy of such order on the next court business day to the clerk-magistrate of the court. If relief has been granted without the filing of a petition pursuant to section 131R, the petitioner shall appear in court on the next available court business day to file a petition.

The sheriff shall also require prior to the issuance of the directive and handgun permit, that the person successfully complete a suitable training period in the use of firearms in a state certified training program, which training shall include performance tests on a firing range, indicating the person to be qualified in the use of firearms; and the directive shall indicate that the person is properly qualified in the use of firearms and is knowledgeable as to safety precautions. Further, prior to issuing the directive and permit, the sheriff shall require the person to have in effect a liability policy in the amount of not less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) evidenced by a certificate of insurance made to the issuing sheriff. The insurance required must be for the specific purpose of carrying a firearm and must so state on the face of the policy. This requirement does not preclude insurance which by its nature provides coverage for this purpose as well as other general liability provisions. In lieu of liability insurance, the person may make a corporate surety bond in the amount of not less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) for the above purpose, a copy of which must be provided to the sheriff by the bonding company. The sheriff shall charge to the person to whom the directive and permit is issued a fee in such amount as will pay the expenses involved in the training of the person in the use of firearms, if the training is conducted by or at the expense of the county. The sheriff may allow the training to be conducted by others, with the results being certified in writing to the satisfaction of the sheriff.

(3) The sheriff issuing the written directive authorizing a person to carry a handgun under this section may further require compliance with rules and regulations set by the sheriff regarding uniforms to be worn by the party carrying the handgun as a prerequisite to issuing the written directive and permit, and may revoke the written directive and permit at such time as the sheriff finds that any of the rules and regulations under this section have been violated, or for any other reason in the judgment of the sheriff which indicates the person's disqualification to carry a handgun, or to continue in the deputy's capacity as a deputy sheriff. In any event, the directive and permit issued shall expire one (1) year from the date of issue subject to reissue upon compliance of all prerequisites.
